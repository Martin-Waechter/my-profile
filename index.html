			<h1>Gamer's profile : Martin</h1>

			<p>Hi, I'm Martin and I study at ESSEC. I'm a big fan of video games. I play a wide range of games, from well-known FPS to more specific management games.</p>

			<h2>Civilization VI</h2>
			<img src="images/civilization.png">
			<p>I like management. I played a lot of Civilization VI. With several hundred hours on the game I have acquired a good level. This game has helped me a lot in my ability to plan and organise.</p>

			<h2>Victoria 3</h2>
			<img src="images/victoria.png">
			<p>I am interessed in economics. I have discovered Victoria 3 this year and I am very found of this game. I love playing with the mechanics in it and it helped me a lot with my economic classes. I also recommand this game for people that are particularly interessed in history as this game allow you to go back in the 19th century.</p>

			<h2>Overwatch</h2>
			<img src="images/overwatch.png">
			<p>I like to work with teammates. Overwatch is probably the game I've played the most. This team-based FPS allows you to build strong bonds with your friends. The story around the characters is also great and allows you to get attached to them. I personally love the character Reinhardt.</p>

			<h2>Sea of Thieves</h2>
			<img src="images/sea-of-thieves.png">
			<p>I have the soul of an adventurer. Sea of Thieves is my favourite game to play with friends. Crossing beautiful oceans, following treasure maps and solving puzzles are the ingredients for a great evening with friends.</p>
